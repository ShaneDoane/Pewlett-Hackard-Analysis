# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to understand how many employees are retiring soon and to help identify what positions those soon-to-be retirees are in, what departments, etc. We also identified non-retiring senior employees who could become mentors for the next generation of employees at Pewlett-Hackard (PH). I used SQL and PGAdmin/Postgres to create a database of employee info and tables with relevant information pertaining to our goals of understanding the 'silver tsunami' aka generation of retiring employees.

## Results
* Our retirement_titles table shows tha we have over tens of thousands of employees retiring soon
* It also shows we have many retirees in senior positions.

* Our mentorship_eligibility table shows we only have about 1500 employees who qualify to mentor
* With tens of thousands of positions opening soon, we may want to expand our requirements to mentor

## Conclusion

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* * 72,458 jobs will be opening from near future retirees

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
* * By our current mentorship criteria only roughly 1500 people are ready to mentor for over 40,000 jobs. This is not enough

Additional queries to help with this question could include something more specific to titles within departments to find where mentors with current criteria have enough to suffice. Another could include a query of current employees who are ready to fill retiring positions as a promotion.
